# Rationale

We are going to learn Git by doing an example.
The example will be the creation of a story-maps repository.

The tutorial is split in two sections, first an explanation about Git and
then a hands-on block.
During the explanation I will set up the basics of the repository, where
basic documentation and test infrastructure will be set.
Then, the students will handle git during their stories creation; here they
will certainly add, push, fetch, pull, merge, branch, checkout the repo.


# Roadmap

* Hands-on
  * clone the repository
  * add content to be tested by script
  * commit
  * push
